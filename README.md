# Dead-Poets-Society




A free form project where I created the backend for a litle blog, called the Dead-Poets_Society, where anyone can Sign-In and add comments on the home page, but only
members who knows the secrete passcode can enter The Dead Poets Society and see the name of the author of the comments.

* A space where loggend in people can post litle twetts on the home Page
